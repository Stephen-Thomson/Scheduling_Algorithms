# Scheduling_Algorithms
## What is it?
Scheduling Algorithms reads in a file of Task Sets, then tests 
the effectiveness of the scheduling algorithms: EDF, LLF, and Algorithm-A.
The user has the option to print the selected results or write the 
entire results to a given text file.

### Features
- Reads any valid text file of Task Sets
- Can test Algorithms EDF, LLF, and Algorithm-A
- Calculates time to run the algorithm once or the average of multiple runs
- Can write results to a file
